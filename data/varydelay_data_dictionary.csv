"Q3.1","The Effect of Differential Delay on Time Preferences Across Adulthood

 

Welcome to the Time Preferences research project, a web-based experiment that examines how the timing of a gain affects decision making across the lifespan. Before taking part in this study, please read the consent form below and click on the ""I consent"" button at the bottom of the page if you understand the statements and freely consent to participate in the study. 

 

Consent Form

This study involves a web-based experiment designed to examine how the length of a delay affects decision making for people of all ages. The study is being conducted by Dr. Kendra Seaman of the University of Texas at Dallas, and it has been approved by the The University of Texas at Dallas Institutional Review Board. No deception is involved, and the study involves no more than minimal risk to participants (i.e: the level of risk encountered in daily life). 

 

Participation in the study typically takes 7-9 minutes and is strictly confidential. Participants begin by answering a few questions about themselves and how they perceive their lifespan. The study continues with a series of questions asking participants to choose which option they would prefer, and concludes with a few questions about saving habits.  All responses are treated as confidential, and in no case will responses from individual participants be identified. Rather, all data will be pooled and published in aggregate form only. Participants should be aware, however that the experiment is not being run from a ""secure"" server, like those that are used to handle credit card transactions. So there is a small possibility that responses could be viewed by unauthorized third parties (e.g., computer hackers). 

 

Many individuals find participation in this study enjoyable, and no adverse reactions have been reported. Participation is voluntary- refusal to take part in the study involves no penalty or loss of benefits to which participants are otherwise entitled, and participants may withdraw from the study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which they are otherwise entitled. In exchange for completing the study, participants will receive e-rewards currency, as described in their study invitation. 



If participants have further questions about this study, they may contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Kendra Seaman at kendra.seaman@utdallas.edu. Participants who want more information about their rights as a participant or who want to report a research related concern may contact The University of Texas at Dallas Institutional Review Board at (972)-883-4579.
