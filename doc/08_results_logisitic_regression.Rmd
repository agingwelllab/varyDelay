# Logistic Regression of age, delay(days), and age x delay(days) on choice

```{r age x delay in days on choice model, echo=FALSE}
summary(M2)
```
There are significant main effects of age and of delay (in days) on choice. There is also a signficiant age x delay (in days) interaction on choice.

# Graphing age x delay in days on choice
```{r choice ~ age x days, echo=FALSE}
choice_by_age_by_delay_n_days
```

SS=1, LL=0

For delays of 10 years (3650 days), older adults discount more (choose SS more often)
